# Civil-Aviation-Accident-Analysis.
Conducted an in-depth analysis of civil aviation accident data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib). Cleaned and filtered data to remove inconsistencies, extracted key insights, and visualized trends to identify factors influencing accidents. The project highlights patterns in fatalities, accident causes, and date-based trends to enhance aviation safety. Performed data exploration to uncover correlations between accident frequency, aircraft types, and environmental conditions. Developed visual representations to support data-driven decision-making and improve safety measures in the aviation industry.
